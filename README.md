# pvz2-level-maker
Fast and easy to use level creator for Plants vs. Zombies 2 modding.

This is the first Scala project I've shared on GitHub. Please let me know if the files in this repository are enough to build this project.

## Download

Go to the releases tab and download the JAR file. It currently works with JRE/JDK 8 or newer.

## How to Use

Paste the level you want to edit into the right text box, and click Finish Editing.
This will list all the waves in the level on the left side of the UI.

Click Reload Zombies to automatically get a list of zombies in this level and show them in the top bar.
You can add zombie types manually by using the "Add Zombie" feature on the top right.

Click the text box of a wave, and then click a zombie on the top bar to add it to the level. (You can also use the ` key)

To add a zombie to a specific lane, move your mouse over the zombie button and then press the number keys 1-5
